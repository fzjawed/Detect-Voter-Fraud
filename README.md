Kyungsoo's high notes are something else 🧖‍♀️

14 questions and will have completed 50 easy coding questions 😌 I hope I remember how to do them when the time comes.

***Questions: Given a two dimensional list of integers votes, where each list has two elements [candidate_id, voter_id], report whether any voter has voted more than once.***

If you're here to tell me I did it in an inefficient manner - 🚪 - there's the door to leave. Jokes ur right I didn't do it in the best way possible but I wanted to do it in a different way. 

And using this way I was able to learn about ``any()`` in dictionaries. Basically what it does is check if any of the key values match a condition that is specified. 

`` From docs:``

``**any()**: Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return False.``
``Equivalent to``
``` 
def any(iterable):
    for element in iterable:
        if element:
            return True
    return False```
